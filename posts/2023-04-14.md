@@ I tried the Artifact app today - TikTok for text. I don’t get it. It’s a terrible experience, full of ads, because apparently, news portals deliver ads sprinkled with the news. And the app opens the portal’s original pages. No way to default to reader mode. Even sharing is painful as there’s no way to share the original URL but the Artifact one. Basically, the app is a ploy to beef up engagement. Another disappointing news take.
