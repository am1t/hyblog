@@ My choice of a platform where I write goes through a cycle. There is a phase when I consolidate all my writing into a single place. Then soon, I am posting at multiple places simultaneously. I am currently in a diversification phase, settling on two platforms to write at.

The thing is, I am tired of making decisions about which platform is the best. Or which platform suits me the best. I write where I feel most comfortable at the moment.

@@ I often forget to publish the thoughts I have. I am happy that I at least write them down somewhere. But what good are the words that I cannot go back to? 

Just as unpublished thoughts, the lack of discovery is also applicable to microposts. Are short-form posts the noise on your blog? While curating a select few favourite posts today, I realized I am not proud of the many posts that I have published. The majority (all?) of them are microposts.
